## Description
FeelChat aims to improve digital communication by addressing the common problem of emotionally uninformed interactions, which can lead to misunderstandingsâ€”especially in customer service and community management contexts. The app leverages Next.js for frontend development, Node.js for backend services, Pusher for real-time messaging, and the Sentiment NPM package for real-time sentiment analysis. Messages are categorized as positive, neutral, or negative, with visual feedback provided through color-coded indicators or emojis to help users understand the tone of conversations.
